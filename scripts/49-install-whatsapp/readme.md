## Overview

Implementation folder for **Script 49 — Install Whatsapp**. Installs WhatsApp Desktop via Chocolatey, with an automatic fallback (added in v0.73.0) to the official Microsoft-published `WhatsAppSetup.exe` installer when the Chocolatey package fails or its install path cannot be verified. The full design contract lives in the spec.

## Quick start

```powershell
# From repo root
.\run.ps1 -I 49 install

# Force-test the fallback path (point choco at a bogus package name)
# Edit config.json -> whatsapp.chocoPackage = "whatsapp-does-not-exist"
.\run.ps1 -I 49 install

# Uninstall (now sweeps registry + shortcuts after choco -- v0.74.0+)
.\run.ps1 -I 49 uninstall
```

## Fallback behaviour (v0.73.0+)

If `choco install whatsapp` returns failure, **or** completes but `WhatsApp.exe` is not found in any expected install root, the script downloads `https://web.whatsapp.com/desktop/windows/release/x64/WhatsAppSetup.exe` and runs it silently with `/S`. Configurable under `config.json -> whatsapp.fallback`. Installs recorded via fallback are tracked with `Method = "official-installer"` so you can tell them apart from Chocolatey installs in `.installed/`.

## Uninstall cleanup (v0.74.0+)

After `choco uninstall whatsapp` runs, `Invoke-WaPostUninstallCleanup` sweeps leftover state:

- **Registry**: HKCU/HKLM `Software\WhatsApp`, `Software\Classes\WhatsApp`, `Uninstall\WhatsApp`, autostart `Run\WhatsApp`.
- **Shortcuts**: Start Menu (per-user + all-users, `.lnk` and folder), Desktop (per-user + public), Taskbar pin, Start Menu pin.
- **AppData (opt-in)**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WhatsApp` is **kept by default** (chat cache lives here). Set `config.whatsapp.uninstallCleanup.purgeAppData = true` to nuke it.

Each target is logged individually (removed / missing-clean / failed) plus a one-line summary. Disable the whole sweep by setting `config.whatsapp.uninstallCleanup.enabled = false`.

## Layout

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `run.ps1` | Entry point dispatched by the root `run.ps1`. |
| `config.json` | External config (paths, toggles, edition list). |
| `log-messages.json` | All user-facing messages (kept out of code). |
| `helpers/` | Internal PowerShell helper modules. |
