# Script 01 — VS Code MIME defaults cleanup (v0.165.0)

## Why
The apt and snap install paths register `code.desktop` (and on first
launch, VS Code itself adds `code-url-handler.desktop`) as the default
handler for dozens of text/source MIME types via the freedesktop
mimeapps spec. `apt-get remove code` deletes `/usr/share/applications/code.desktop`
but does NOT remove the references to it from per-user
`~/.config/mimeapps.list` or the legacy `~/.local/share/applications/defaults.list`.
Result: file managers keep showing "Open with Code" greyed out and
`xdg-open` fails for those MIME types until the user hand-edits the file.

## What the cleanup does
On `verb_uninstall`, after `apt-get remove`/`snap remove`,
`_clean_mime_defaults` runs an STRICT allow-list scrub. It NEVER deletes
whole files and NEVER touches sibling associations.

### config.json: `mimeCleanup` block
- `enabled` — set false to skip entirely (e.g. user reinstalled via flatpak)
- `desktopFiles[]` — exact .desktop tokens to strip
  (`code.desktop`, `code-url-handler.desktop`, `code_code.desktop`,
  `code-insiders.desktop`, `code-insiders-url-handler.desktop`)
- `userFiles[]` — files in $HOME to scrub (`${HOME}` is the only
  variable expanded)
- `systemFiles[]` — files under `/usr` and `/etc` (sudo)
- `cacheFiles[]` — touched only for logging; rebuilt via
  `update-desktop-database`, never deleted

### Scrub logic (sed chain)
For each allow-listed `<desktop>`:
1. `^[^=]*=<desktop>;\?$` — drop whole line where the value is ONLY the
   allow-listed token
2. `=<desktop>;` → `=` — strip from start of value list
3. `;<desktop>;` → `;` — strip from middle of value list
4. `;<desktop>$` → `` — strip from end of value list
5. `^[^=]*=$` — drop any line left with empty RHS

After scrub, sibling tokens like `gedit.desktop;sublime.desktop` and
unrelated lines like `text/html=firefox.desktop` are PRESERVED byte-
for-byte.

### Safety
- Each modified file gets a `.bak-01-<timestamp>` copy BEFORE write-back
- Original mode preserved via `chmod` round-trip
- `cmp -s` (or `diff -q` fallback) skips files with no matching entries
  — no spurious backups
- All file/path errors go through `log_file_error` per CODE RED rule

## Verified test cases
| Input fixture line | Expected outcome | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| `text/plain=code.desktop` | line dropped | ✅ |
| `text/x-python=code.desktop;` | line dropped | ✅ |
| `text/x-c=gedit.desktop;code.desktop;sublime.desktop;` | code stripped, siblings preserved | ✅ |
| `text/markdown=code.desktop;ghostwriter.desktop` | code stripped, ghostwriter preserved | ✅ |
| `text/x-shellscript=vim.desktop;code.desktop` | code stripped (end-of-list), vim preserved | ✅ |
| `application/json=code-insiders.desktop` | line dropped | ✅ |
| `application/x-yaml=code.desktop;code-insiders.desktop;` | both stripped, line dropped | ✅ |
| `text/html=firefox.desktop` | UNTOUCHED (not allow-listed) | ✅ |
| `text/x-rust=code_code.desktop;rustrover.desktop` | code_code stripped, rustrover preserved | ✅ |

## Files
- `scripts-linux/01-install-vscode/config.json` — `mimeCleanup` block
- `scripts-linux/01-install-vscode/run.sh` — `_clean_mime_defaults` helper
  invoked from `verb_uninstall`

## Out of scope (see suggestions)
- Reverse cleanup for the snap variant's `code_code.desktop` cache under
  `~/snap/code/current/.config/mimeapps.list`
- xdg-mime per-MIME re-default to next-best handler (script just leaves
  the MIME unset, letting xdg-open's normal precedence rules pick)
- Cleanup for the .deb variant's per-arch `/var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications/`
  cache (snapd manages it itself on `snap remove`)

## v0.166.0 — `_clean_vscode_desktop_entries` (in-file scrub)

The original `_clean_mime_defaults` only scrubbed REFERENCES from
`mimeapps.list` / `defaults.list`. But VS Code's OWN `.desktop` files
(written by apt postinst, snap install, and `code --install-extension`
shell-integration prompts) also contain `MimeType=`, `Actions=`, and
`[Desktop Action <name>]` group blocks. On snap removal and partial
uninstalls these per-user copies survive and still claim MIME ownership.

`_clean_vscode_desktop_entries` strips ONLY:
- `MimeType=...` lines (whole line)
- `Actions=...`  lines (whole line)
- `[Desktop Action <name>]` group blocks (header through next group/EOF)

It PRESERVES every other key (`Name`, `GenericName`, `Comment`, `Exec`,
`TryExec`, `Icon`, `Type`, `Categories`, `StartupNotify`, `StartupWMClass`,
`Keywords`, `NoDisplay`, `Hidden`, `OnlyShowIn`, `NotShowIn`, `X-*`).

It NEVER touches a `.desktop` file whose basename is not in
`mimeCleanup.desktopFiles[]`. `firefox.desktop`, `gimp.desktop`, etc. are
verified byte-for-byte unchanged via sha256sum in the test fixture.

### Searched directories (`mimeCleanup.desktopEntryDirs[]`)
- `${HOME}/.local/share/applications`
- `${HOME}/.local/share/applications/wine/Programs`
- `/usr/share/applications`
- `/var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications`
- `/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications`
- `${HOME}/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications`

Only files matching `desktopFiles[] x desktopEntryDirs[]` are considered.
Sudo is used for any path outside `$HOME`. First-line sanity check
refuses to touch any file that doesn't start with `[Desktop Entry]` or a
`#` comment.

### Change-detection hardening
Both helpers now try `cmp` -> `diff` -> `md5sum` -> shell string compare
(handles minimal sandbox/container environments missing coreutils
diff/cmp). No-op files no longer get spurious `.bak-*` backups.

Backup naming differs to keep the two scrubs distinct on disk:
- `_clean_mime_defaults` writes `<file>.bak-01-<ts>`
- `_clean_vscode_desktop_entries` writes `<file>.bak-01de-<ts>`

### Verified test cases (v0.166.0)
| Input | Outcome | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| `code.desktop` with MimeType/Actions/2 Action blocks | keys + blocks stripped, all other keys preserved | ✅ |
| `code-url-handler.desktop` with no MimeType/Actions | NO change, NO backup written | ✅ |
| `firefox.desktop` with MimeType + Actions + `[Desktop Action ...]` | byte-for-byte unchanged (sha256 verified) | ✅ |
| Non-existent dirs (snap, flatpak, wine, /usr/share missing) | skipped silently | ✅ |

## v0.167.0 — `_clean_context_menu_entries`

Adds a third helper invoked from `verb_uninstall` after the MIME-defaults
and .desktop-entry scrubs. Removes "Open with Code" context-menu
integrations across all major Linux file managers + the integration
shims VS Code's install tree ships.

### Three independent allow-list pairs

1. **Shell-script integrations** (`fileNames[]` x `searchDirs[]`)
   Nautilus / Nemo / Caja / Thunar drop executable scripts into per-user
   directories. We delete files whose basename matches `fileNames[]` AND
   whose parent dir is in `searchDirs[]`. Names covered: "Open with
   Code", "Open with Code.sh", "Open in Code", "Open with VSCode",
   "Open with VS Code", "Open with Code - Insiders", "open-with-code",
   "open-with-code.sh", "code-context.sh", "vscode-open-here.sh".

2. **File-manager actions** (`actionFileNames[]` x `actionDirs[]`)
   Modern Files (>=43), Nemo, and Caja support XML/.desktop action
   files in `~/.local/share/{file-manager,nemo,caja}/actions/` and
   `/usr/share/.../actions/`. We delete only allow-listed basenames
   (`open-with-code.desktop`, `open-with-code.nemo_action`, etc.).

3. **VS Code install-tree shims** (`integrationFiles[]` x `integrationRoots[]`)
   VS Code's install tree (`/usr/share/code/resources/app/bin`,
   snap/flatpak counterparts, `~/.vscode/bin`) sometimes ships
   `code-context.sh`, `code-shell-integration.sh`, `open-with-code.sh`.
   These are removed in-place; the install dir itself is untouched.

### Safety invariants
- File deletion only -- directories are NEVER removed (`refuse to
  delete directory` warning if a path resolves to one).
- Each delete writes a `.bak-01ctx-<timestamp>` snapshot first; on
  snapshot failure we abort the delete (CODE RED file-error logged).
- Symlinks are removed without snapshot (cp -p preserves the link
  itself, so a snapshot-then-unlink is safe but uninformative; we just
  log "is a symlink -- removing without backup").
- Sudo prefix auto-selected: `$HOME/...` paths use no sudo, every other
  path uses sudo.

### Verified test cases (v0.167.0)
| Fixture | Expected | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/Open with Code` (allow-listed) | removed + `.bak-01ctx-*` written | ✅ |
| `~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/Open with Sublime` (sibling) | sha256 unchanged | ✅ |
| `~/.local/share/nemo/scripts/open-with-code.sh` (allow-listed) | removed + backup | ✅ |
| `~/.local/share/nemo/scripts/compress-to-zip.sh` (sibling) | sha256 unchanged | ✅ |
| `~/.local/share/file-manager/actions/open-with-code.desktop` (allow-listed) | removed + backup | ✅ |
| `~/.local/share/file-manager/actions/compress.desktop` (sibling) | sha256 unchanged | ✅ |
| `~/.vscode/bin/code-context.sh` (allow-listed) | removed + backup | ✅ |
| `~/.vscode/bin/some-user-helper.sh` (sibling) | sha256 unchanged | ✅ |
| Missing dirs (Caja, Thunar uca.xml.d, snap install root) | skipped silently | ✅ |

## v0.168.0 — Scope-aware cleanup

Cleanup is now bounded by detected install method (apt/snap/flatpak/tarball)
AND edition (stable/insiders). Each allow-list entry in `config.json`
carries `methods[]` + `editions[]` tags; entries whose tags don't intersect
the active scope are SKIPPED, not deleted.

### Three scope sources (priority order)
1. **Override env** — `VSCODE_CLEAN_METHODS`, `VSCODE_CLEAN_EDITIONS`
2. **Fingerprint** — `.installed/01.fingerprint` (JSON: methods, editions,
   version, source, installedAt) written at install time by
   `_write_install_fingerprint`. Survives reinstall via different method.
3. **Live detection** — `_resolve_install_scope` probes `dpkg -s`,
   `snap list`, `flatpak list`, and method-specific install dirs.

### Empty scope = REPORT-ONLY mode
When no install is detected and no override is given, all three cleaners
log what they WOULD touch but make no changes. Verified: with empty scope,
fixtures pass sha256 byte-for-byte unchanged and zero `.bak-*` files written.

### New verb: `scope`
`./run.sh scope` prints resolved methods/editions/source + fingerprint
contents without touching anything. Use for ops dry-run.

### Scope filter (`_scoped_filter`)
Single jq pass that accepts BOTH legacy strings and tagged objects
(`{name|path, methods, editions}`). Returns only entries matching the
active scope. Verified across 4 test scopes:

| Scope | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `snap/stable` | `code_code.desktop` only; system files empty; only `/var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications` dir matches |
| `apt/stable` | `code.desktop` + `code-url-handler.desktop`; `/usr/share/code/...` integration root |
| `apt/insiders` | Insiders names only; `Open with Code` correctly excluded |
| empty | Zero matches → REPORT-ONLY kicks in |

## v0.169.0 — Before/after verification step

Added `_collect_state_snapshot` (read-only probe) + `_print_state_diff`
(classified report) + `verb_verify` (standalone). Wired into
`verb_uninstall` so every cleanup run prints a clear before/after summary.

### Probed surfaces (read-only)
1. **VS Code .desktop files** in 5 known applications dirs (8 known
   basenames including snap `code_code.desktop` + flatpak
   `com.visualstudio.code.desktop`). Sub-probes: residual `MimeType=`,
   `Actions=`, `[Desktop Action *]` blocks.
2. **mimeapps.list / defaults.list** — one row per line whose RHS
   references a `code*.desktop` handler (across 6 user/system locations).
3. **Nautilus / Nemo / Caja scripts** — name-match OR content-match
   (files <64KB grepped for `\bcode\b`). Catches scripts named
   generically like `launch-editor.sh` that internally call code.
4. **File-manager action files** (.desktop / .nemo_action) referencing code.
5. **VS Code integration shims** (`code-context.sh`,
   `code-shell-integration.sh`, `open-with-code.sh`) inside install trees
   — searched 3 levels deep to catch `~/.vscode/bin/<sha>/code-context.sh`.
6. **`xdg-mime query default`** — only flags when the active handler
   IS a code* desktop file. The user-facing "what app opens .py right now?".

### Output classification
Each diff classifies findings as REMOVED (green ok), STILL PRESENT
(yellow warn), or NEW (yellow warn — appeared between snapshots).
Final VERDICT line: clean / residue remains.

### Verified (3 scenarios)
- **Dirty fixture** → 9 findings; nemo script matched by **content** not
  name (proves fallback works); firefox.desktop correctly NOT flagged.
- **Partial cleanup** → 5 REMOVED + 4 STILL PRESENT, exact classification.
- **Clean system** → "No VS Code context-menu / MIME entries found",
  zero false positives.

### New verb: `verify`
`./run.sh verify` — read-only single snapshot, no diff. Useful pre-flight
check or for confirming a manual cleanup worked.
