type: feature

# Install-paths trio

`scripts/shared/install-paths.ps1` exposes `Write-InstallPaths -Source -Temp -Target [-Tool] [-Action]`.

Every install / extract / repair / sync action MUST call it after the banner
and before the first download/install step. Missing values render as
`(unknown)` in yellow but the call is still mandatory.

Spec: `02-spec/shared/install-paths.md`.

Helper also exposes `Resolve-DefaultTempDir -ToolSlug <slug>` which returns
`$env:TEMP\scripts-fixer\<slug>` (created on demand).

JSON log event shape: `installPaths tool=… action=… source=… temp=… target=…`
