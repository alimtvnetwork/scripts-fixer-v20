# Generic Install-Script Behavior — Cross-Repo Spec

**Status:** Draft v1 (defaults locked, ready for implementation)
**Scope:** Applies to every repo in the `<base>-v<N>` family that ships
`quick-install`, `release-install`, or `error-manage` entry points.
**Defaults locked on:** 2026-04-23 (Malaysia, UTC+8).

## What this spec replaces

- The single-purpose `02-spec/install-bootstrap/readme.md` (still valid for
  the `install.ps1` bootstrap, but narrower in scope).
- Ad-hoc per-repo behaviors for `release-install`, `quick-install`, and
  `error-manage`. From v0.75.0 onward, all three obey this spec.

## Locked defaults (from user, 2026-04-23)

| Decision | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Discovery range | **Fixed window v1..v20** (not relative `current..current+20`) |
| Probe mechanism | **HTTP HEAD** with 5s timeout, parallel |
| Probe target | `https://github.com/<owner>/<base>-v<N>` (200 = exists) |
| On newer found | **Auto-redirect** to highest live version |
| On no newer found | **Log only** (`[VERSION]`, `[RESOLVED]`), continue with current |
| Strict release-tag mode | Triggered by `release-install`, `--release` flag, `SCRIPTS_FIXER_RELEASE` env, or any URL containing `/releases/download/` |
| Main-branch fallback | Allowed for `quick-install` only; **forbidden** for `release-install` |
| Loop guard | `SCRIPTS_FIXER_REDIRECTED=1` after one hop |
| Spec file layout | `02-spec/00-generic-install-script-behavior/NN-name.md`, numbered |

## Non-goals

- Does **not** cover the per-script installers under `scripts/NN-install-*`.
- Does **not** replace `02-spec/install-bootstrap/readme.md` for the
  bootstrap's internal algorithm — that doc stays authoritative for the
  HEAD-probe parallelization details.
- Does **not** auto-upgrade installed tools; only the bootstrap entry
  point is redirected.

## Versioning

Bump the parent project minor version any time this spec changes a
default. Document the change in `changelog.md` under the matching
release.
